# ReadableReddit

##### An Android App for all the passive readers of [reddit](https://www.reddit.com) Featuring a minimalistic user interface, so no more gouging your eyes out trying to parse the posts.

##### Built with the amazing [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) library, a must try if you are a victim of AsyncTasks. A little functional programming never hurt anyone. 

##### [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) is the library that is taking charge of all the image related stuff. 

##### Finally, [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) is used to make all the calls to the API, nothing goes better with RxJava, and any app remains incomplete without Jake Wharton's code.

##### I have turned this,
